# Smudge's Decks

Slide decks for talks that I have given.

They are composed in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and are compatible with [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

New talks will be posted as [pull requests](../../pulls) and merged after they have been presented.

## Viewing

To view a deck, drag and drop the file into [remarkise](https://remarkjs.com/remarkise).

Use `j` and `k` or the arrow keys to navigate between slides.

### Presenting

Presentation mode can be enabled by pressing `p`. This will display the speaker notes.

To break out a second, mirrored window, press `c` and drop the same file into the new window. Now you can control both windows with the same keypresses!

## TODO:

For image support, I'll need to add tooling to generate the talks locally.
