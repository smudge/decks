# Smudge's Decks

Slide decks for talks that I have given.

They are composed in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and are compatible with either [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) or [Slidev](https://sli.dev) (depending on the deck).

New talks will be posted as [pull requests](../../pulls) and merged after they have been presented.

## Slidev Decks

For a Slidev-based talk, cd into the folder and run:

- `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
- `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`)
- visit http://localhost:3030

#### Presenting

Presentation mode can be enabled via the controls in the lower left of the default slide view, or by visiting http://localhost:3030/presenter/1.

(Visit [sli.dev](https://sli.dev/) for more documentation.)

## Remark Decks

To view a deck, drag and drop the file into [remarkise](https://remarkjs.com/remarkise).

Use `j` and `k` or the arrow keys to navigate between slides.

#### Presenting

Presentation mode can be enabled by pressing `p`. This will display the speaker notes.

To break out a second, mirrored window, press `c` and drop the same file into the new window. Now you can control both windows with the same keypresses!

### TODO:

For image support, I'll need to add tooling to generate the talks locally.
