# So You Want to Give a Conference Talk
### BetterDev (2021-07-04)

#### Nathan Griffith, a.k.a. @smudge

???

- Hi, I'm Nathan.
- I'm on the Fullstack Platform Team.
- I'm in the NY offices most Thursdays and sometimes Tuesdays, and probably more days in the near future.
- And my talk today is about giving talks.
- My goal today isn't to tell you how to give a talk. Rather, if you're interested in giving a talk at a major conference, I'd hope to inspire you to make that leap.

# 

???

- So, in April I gave a talk at RailsConf 2021.
- You might've watched it, but it's also fine if you didn't. I'm not offended. 
- I was considering giving part of it again today, but instead I decided to get a little meta.
- I think the talk went well, overall, and I'm **really** happy I did it.
- But even if you were sort of following along when I was working on it, there are a few things that you probably didn't know.

---

???

- For one, this was my very talk at a conference or meetup of any kind, not including BetterDev.
- It was kind of my first public speaking gig in general, not including my child acting career.
- And definitely not including the time that I won a beauty pageant.
- (And, by the way, that should get you at least part way to solving the two truths and a lie, that I gave Nick).
- But basically, in my adult life, this was the first time that I put myself out there in front of strangers in a non-karaoke, non-internal-to-Betterment professional context.

---

???

- Another thing you may not know, is that I was rejected. From RailsConf 2020.
- I applied with the same general idea, and I was told "no" the first time around.

---

???

- Lastly, when my proposal was finally accepted a year later, I hadn't actually written any slides.
- I hadn't really prepared _anything_ beyond the proposal itself.
- So, when I finally knew what the deadlines were, I had about 3 weeks to develop and record a 30-to-40 minute talk.

---


???

- All of this is to say, it was a very nerve-wracking experience, I was kind of a mess for a while, and there were a lot of things I wish I had known, or thought about, or been told
- and so I'm here today to share a few of those with you

---

???

- So, part one, is just to understand the overall process of applying to speak at one of these bigger conferences.
- I really had no idea what it entailed going in, but I quickly learned that it was actually a lot less intimidating than it seemed.
- You really only need two things: a plausible-sounding idea and a thoughtfully-crafted proposal.

---

## Part 1: Proposing A Talk

???

- So, I'll get to the idea part later, but first what does that proposal look like?
- Also, not all conferences use the same format, but most conferences will have somethign like this.

---

## Proposing A Talk
### The Title

???

- First is the title of your talk, but I'd suggest leaving this blank until the very end.
- You probably want something in here that doesn't sound too dry and draws attention, but don't get hung up on it.
- You probably need to work through the rest of the proposal first.
- I was never really happy with the titles I submitted, and I actually changed my talk's title at the last minute, right before I started doing final recordings.
- So let's move on for now.

---

## Proposing A Talk
### The  Abstract

???

- After your title is your abstract.
- Now, this is my actual abstract. It's what went on the public program notes.
- Your abstract is what's going to draw conference-goers to your room.
- So think of this less as a summary of your talk, and more as an elevator pitch.
- So it's okay to be a little whimsical or cheesy, or include a short narrative, but you'll also want to a real hook.
- So, ask yourself, who is your audience, and what could you say that would make them excited or intrigued by your talk
- And then say it here!
- Oh, and, probably best to avoid jargon or niche terms.

---

## Proposing A Talk
### The Outline

???

- Secondly, you'll be asked to write a more detailed breakdown or outline. Only the review committee will see this.
- What you want to demonstrate here is:
  - That you generally know what you're talking about.
  - That you know who your audience will be at the conference, and you've tailored your content to them.
  - That you've thought about what you'd like your audience to take away from the talk. What is the desired outcome?
  - That you have the right amount of material for the time allotted.
- In my 2021 proposal, I actually included estimated timestamps for each topic.

---

## Proposing A Talk
### The Pitch

???

- Sometimes your outline _is_ your pitch to the review committee, but
- for RailsConf, I was asked to provide a separate paragraph or two explaining why I should be considered.
- I actually found this kind of tricky to write.
- I ended up giving it its own little narrative, with an anecdote that led into a bit of my personal motivation.

---

## Proposing A Talk
### Choosing A Track

???

- Conferences often have different tracks, or topics, and you'll want to think about whether yours fits any of them.
- Sometimes tracks have limited capacity. In 2020, my talk was actually held for consideration in one track, while other tracks continued to fill up.
- So, in 2021, I submitted to the general track instead.

---

## Proposing A Talk
### Submit It Early

???

A lot of conferences accept proposals on a rolling basis.
So submit yours early if you can, before the big wave of submissions.
(But submit anyways even if it's the last minute.)

---

## Proposing A Talk
### Rejection & Feedback

- In 2020, I submitted my talk to the "Rails at Scale" track.
- I tailored a lot of my proposal to the idea of writing resilient controllers at scale. I put a lot of thought into this kind of spin.
- And... I was rejected.
- But I was also given some valuable feedback. I changed the title, reworked the pitch, submitted to a different track, included timestamps. And, then, it worked!
- So that rejected proposal was totally worth it!
- I wish I had started having proposals rejected years ago! Getting that kind of feedback, and then not actually having to give the talk, kind of felt great.

# Part 2: Preparing the Talk

???

Everybody does this differently. 

---

## Start from Somewhere

???

All talks start with these seeds of ideas.
And developing the talk is a matter of planting those seeds and seeing how they grow.
Sometimes you have one big acorn. A central thesis from which you grow a

Write a few milemarker slides, and then try to expand on them organically. See where different subtopics lead you.

---

## Give it some Structure

- Beginner's Curiosity
- Idea Mashup
- Broad Overview
- Personal Experience
- Historical Narrative
- Practice Problems

???

- A Beginner's Curiosity - is the story of learning something new
- Idea mashup - explore the intersection of two or more seeminly unrelated thigns. Talks I've heard about: assembly language and pokemon, or javascript and oragami, or archaeology and version control.
- Broad overviews - do a bunch of research into a domain so that your audience doesn't have to. I love these. I use them to keep up with industry trends.
- A personal experience - share something you went through, because others might relate to it or might be going through it too
- Historical narratives - explore a past event, or series of events, or a person's biography, uncover interesting and surprising details, and relate it all back to a general thesis

---

## Be Yourself

???

- Don't try to be an expert. You are already an expert in your own experiences, in thinking the way that you do, so speak from where you are.
- Being interesting and authentic is far better than being novel or impressive.

---

## Get Feedback

???

- Ideally, prepare at least some material before your proposal is accepted.
=> Write a blog post.
=> Pilot a short version of the talk at a meetup, or here at BetterDev!
=> Or simply share your drafts with others.

- Personally, I did none of this, and I wish I had!
=> When my talk was accepted, I had nothing, so I toiled for two weeks, on my own, and it wasn't until week 3 that I showed any of it to anyone.

---

## Don't Be Afraid to Cut Stuff

???

- Being coherent is better than being comprehensive.

---

## It'll Be Okay!

???

- The first thing that I wish I had been told, right off the bat, as soon as my talk was accepted, was that it's okay to give a mediocre talk.
- I didn't know if my talk would be any good, I hope it was, but I had this paralyzing fear that it was going to somehow be a catastrophe.
- That it would be something that my name would be permanently attached to, along with Betterment's, and that would potentially follow me around for my career as a software engineer.
- I know that it's common, as highly driven, highly-motivated people, working in the jobs we do, to have imposter syndrome. And this was, a bit of that.
- It's also just common to be afraid of something new. This was something I wasn't used to.
- So if you're listening to this, and you're starting to get cold sweats about the mere idea of giving a talk, hear these words.
- It's okay to try. Most conference talks aren't amazing.

---

# Part 3: Giving The Talk

???

- For recorded talks, schedule your recording.
- For live talks, don't change things the night before.
=> It's okay


How to be interesting and coherent?
- Speak from where you are. Expertise is entirely relative.
- You are an expert in your own experience, in thinking the way you do. Nobody is better at being you than you are.
