- Because I work in a regulated industry, I've paid careful attention to some of the guarantees we can make when writing code, to achieve operational peace of mind.
- And I've found that being able to trust our persistence operations, our "save" methods, is one of the most important guarantees.
- And so that's what this talk is about: Writing resilient "save" methods.

# Writing resilient .red.bold["save" methods]

"But I already have a save method."

I mean anything that does meaningful persistence work internally.

Maybe that means a controller action. Maybe you're using model callbacks.

At Betterment, we use a kind of Service Object. We call them "Resource Models"

# Writing .red.bold[resilient] "save" methods

???

The ability to recover to a stable, functioning state when something goes wrong. To fail... successfully, and then resume.

# Writing ~~robust~~ .red.bold[resilient] "save" methods

???

What I don't mean is "robust" -- a robust system can absorb failures and keep chugging along for as long as it can, until it doesn't and fails catastrophically.

That's not what I want to talk about today, I'm talking about making our persistence operations resilient to common types of errors.
