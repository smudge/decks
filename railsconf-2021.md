- Hi, I'm Nathan.
- And, uh, thanks for joining me here, on the internet.
- I'm happy to be here, giving this talk, on the internet, but also in my home, which is not the internet.
- Today I'm going to talk about "writing resilient save methods" by "Predicting the Improbable", but more on that later.
- First, a bit about me:

- I'm a staff engineer at Betterment where I work on one of the platform teams.
- My team focuses on a lot of cross-cutting concerns, like performance, scale, resiliency, and developer efficiency.
- Outside of work, I enjoy karaoke, reading books, and lately I've been streaming a ton of Jackbox games over Zoom.
- Now, I joined Betterment in 2016, but I've been working with Ruby on Rails since 2008...

# [rails at scale badge]

???

- Over the years, I've had the opportunity to see Rails applications grow, both in terms of lines of code and number of users.
- And I've had the privilege of helping solve some of the challenges that emerge along the way.
- Let me tell you a story of one such challenge:

---

# 

???

It was a Monday morning, many years and several jobs ago.
I was working at a growing B2B company, planning out an exciting new feature with my team, when an urgent bug report hit our radar.
A bit of payment processing code that had been in production for over a year had, out of nowhere, decided to ... run about 12 times instead of once.
I checked the database to confirm, and, yes. Over the weekend, one of our clients had been charged twelve times for the same order.
I had no idea how this was possible, but there it was.

So, I spent the next few hours puzzling through layers of payment code.
Eventually, I discovered that a very subtle persistence bug had been hiding in plain sight from the very beginning.
It had caused a background job to get stuck in a retry loop, resulting in periodic charges through a 3rd party payment provider.
It was pretty obvious to me at this point, but of course hindsight is 20-20.
Thankfully, the client had a good sense of humor, and so we refunded them, and we shipped a fix, and all was well.
---

???

Maybe this story sounds familiar. For me, it was the first time I really felt the pain of running a live application.
And the question I kept coming back to was... why now? Why did it suddenly fail now, and not weeks ago?

If you're like me, this kind of experience will make you question your entire codebase.
If that very innocuous-looking piece of code could make it through thousands of runs with zero issues,
what other potential errors might be lying in wait, scattered throughout all the code we had written over the years?

---
???

- I didn't have a word for it at the time, but I've come to realize is that the thing I was reaching for was "resiliency"

---
class: center, middle

# "resilient" code

???

- I define "resiliency" as the ability for code to handle adverse conditions and, when something goes really wrong, recover to a stable state
- To fail... quickly, and successfully, in a way that is controlled and predictable, and then resume normal operation when possible.
- Now the "challenge" in this is in writing code that accounts for the realities of a production environment.
- Things like latency, memory leaks, timeouts, network errors, service outages. Let's call all of this entropy.

---

# "entropy"

???

- Now, this kind of entropy, software entropy, isn't a universal law, like like the second law of thermodynamics, 
- but much like that law, what we see in software is that entropy typically increases over time.
- As an application gets more users, receives more traffic, gets more features, does more things, entropy goes up.
- I suspect this is what we often mean by the word "scale"

---

# "scale" ‚âà entropy üìà

???

- It's the entropy of the live application environment that leads us, as application maintainers, to encounter entirely new classes of error.
- You'll begin to uncover things like data integrity issues (where your database has invalid data that starts to crop up),
- or race conditions (where two processes compete for some operation and maybe do something unexpected),
- or just strange bugs in general, like dropped messages, missed emails, pages that sometimes don't render but it's not clear why,
- I mean, the list goes on.
- For me, these weren't the kinds of things I thought about when I set out to build Rails apps in 2008.

---

[build a blog in 5 minutes]

???

- I was thinking about product features, user experiences, wiring together the necessary functionality to build cool and useful things.
- In my world, all of the code underneath either worked or it didn't.
- If it didn't work, we fixed it, and then it worked. Job done, mission accomplished.
- But as I'm sure many of you know very well, that's not how reality works.

---

# üòÆ

???

- It may have taken a while for me to get there, but
- that realization is the _first step_ towards writing resilient code.
- And as I became more responsible for the uptime of apps, I began to change the way I thought about errors.

---

[graph of errors, with a long tail]

???

- If we were to take an application today,
- and graph all the types of errors we saw last month by their frequency, we get something like this.
- And in 2008, I was focused entirely on the left. The errors that were obvious.
- Anything on the right was "transient" or "flakey." We saw it once, but it went away. No worries.
- And to be fair, some things in there _are_ truly transient errors, one-off blips that we're safe to just ignore.
- But some of them are like that payment processing error. They're real bugs, they just don't fail right away.
- There is a long tail of errors that sometimes happen, but are unlikely to happen _today_? Or even this _week_?
- Or, even, ever. There are plenty of _potential_ errors that will never show up in this graph.
- Instead of thinking of this as a known list of issues, we could instead think of it as...

---

[mirrored graph, with a bell curve overlaid]

???

- a bell curve!
- as far as resiliency goes, we're not very worried about the things in the middle.
- these kinds of errors make themselves known quickly, and with enough volume or urgency that we notice them right away and fix them.
- instead, we are are concerned with the outliers.
- errors that may _seem_ very unlikely, but that happen anyways.
- They _might_ happen, but simply haven't happened _yet._
- And that leads us to another realization. The _second step_ towards writing resilient code.

---


## errors are probabilistic

???

- errors. are. probabilistic
- most of the bugs we catch with tests have a high likelihood of occurring.
- but the bugs we don't, the ones that lie in wait, they have a low probability.
- But how should we interpret this?
- Does that mean we shouldn't worry about them? Or should we invest more in preventing them?
- Well, probabilities are just math, right? So maybe we should consult a mathematician.

---

# üèñÔ∏è + [photo of book]

???

- A couple years after that payment snafu, I was reading a book while on vacation.
- It's a great book, despite its title, and I'd definitely recommend it.
- But that day on the beach, one line in particular jumped out at me:

---

## "Improbable things happen a lot"
### - Jordan Ellenberg

???

- Improbable things happen a lot.
- Now, there are whole chapters on how probability theory can help us interpret the world around us.
- But this line in particular could easily be applied to software engineering:

---

## "Improbable ~things~ production errors happen a lot"
### - Jordan Ellenberg
##### - Nathan Griffith

???

- At a certain scale, improbable errors happen a lot.
- We don't know which ones they'll be, we just know that as entropy increases, they'll happen, somewhere in our app.
- This speaks to a phenomenon that a lot of statisticians talk about.
- They call it...

---

# The Law of Truly Large Numbers

???

- It's a law in the same way that Murphy's Law is a law, meaning it's more of an adage.
- It's also not the same thing as the Law of Large Numbers.
- The law of _Truly_ Large Numbers states that, given enough opportunities, we should expect crazy and outrageous things to happen.
- It's not just that they _can_ happen. They _will_ happen.

---

# ‚õàÔ∏è  + üé∞ + ‚õ≥

???

- Common examples of this law in action involve lightning strikes, lotteries, and golf
- Where the same person survives multiple lightning strikes, years apart,
- Or, wins the lottery twice,
- Or, gets two holes in one, two days in a row.
- Maybe not the _same_ person experiences all of the above, but... maybe they do.

---

[ our world in data population growth chart? maybe with earth overlayed? ]

???

- The Law of Truly Large Numbers reminds us that, that since we have nearly 8 billion people on the planet,
- events that seem extraordinarily unlikely should be _expected_ to happen somewhere, every day.

- You know what else supports billions of people?

https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/28/apple-hits-1-5-billion-active-devices
???

- I mean, this list legitimately scares me.
- A billion is A LOT.
- Very, very few of us can expect the code we write to approach anywhere near that number of monthly active users.
- But that doesn't mean that these principles don't apply to us as well.

---

# 

[ bell curve with arrow ]

???

- a failure that has a one-in-a-million chance of occurring _will_ occur if it is given enough chances.
- even a one-in-a-thousand bug might not really show up, until we hit a certain number of users.
- Now, assigning probabilities to production failures is... not something we can realistically do.

---

# [ book cover ]

???

- If you're interested in reading more about how and why such improbable events happen so frequently
- I can recommend another book: The Improbability Principle by David J. Hand, a statistician.
- This book actually came out the _same year_ as my previous recommendation.
- Apparently 2014 was a good year for conference talk material.
- Yet another coincidence that the book might help explain.

---

# _Expect Unlikely Failures_

???

- We've learned now that with enough traffic, we should _expect_ extremely unlikely failures.
- So, scaling your system, introducing entropy, results in new bugs from _old_ code.

---

# Predicting the Improbable: writing resilient "save" methods

???

- So, that brings us all the way back to the title of this talk.
- By now, we should know what "resilient" means

---

???

- What all of these have in common is that they are:
=> difficult to detect with automated tests
=> hard to spot during code review, even when you think you know what you're looking for
=> intermittent and probabilistic. They _seem_ to occur purely by chance, like the Rails gods are grumpy at you.

Sometimes we call them "flakes" and we ignore them.

---

[graph]

???

- So, back to that graph of error frequencies.

---

# ü§î

???

- For one, they tend to happen in and around persistence operations, or, as I like to call them, "save" methods.

---
class: middle
```ruby
def save!
  # ...
end

def update!(**attrs)
  # ...
end

def post_changes_to_api!
  # ...
end

def perform_later
  # ...
end
```

???

- I'm talking about any method that does "persistence" work.
- Maybe it sends things to a database. Maybe it posts them to a remote API. Or maybe it sends something to a job queue.
- It persists a change into the universe, and so 
- And if we want to make our applications more resilient to 

---

# Law of Inevitability

???

- "Something must always happen."
- If a controller action does not succeed, it must still do _something._
- "If you make a list of all possible outcomes, then one of them must occur." (Even if we don't know which one.)

---

# Law of the Probability Lever

???

- "A slight change in circumstances can have a huge impact on probabilities"
Something that seems very unlikely might become a lot more likely given the right conditions.
Say you inadvertently run a very expensive query, and suddenly your DB CPU is maxed out at 100%.
Or maybe your database fails over, causing all connections to go bad at once.
Or you have an unexpected traffic spike, and a bunch of requests pile up and time out en masse.
Point being, you can't assume that your code will always run under ideal conditions.
Something that works today might suddenly break in strange ways because of something totally unrelated.

---

???

The scale tipping point: when the impact of novel errors surpasses the impact of "known" issues.


---


# WRITE IT OUT

Get it to fit in the 

# ASK: CAN I BREAK THIS?

---

???

- Our entire careers, we've been writing variations of the same save operation. 
- It _always_ (or almost always) fits in this structure.


---

```ruby
class PasswordChangesController < ApplicationController
  def create
    password_change = PasswordChange.new(
      user: current_user,
      old_password: permitted_params[:old_password]
      new_password: permitted_params[:new_password]
    )

    if password_change.save
      # yay
    else
      # boo
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
class PasswordChange
  include ActiveModel::Model

  attr_accessor :user, :old_password, :new_password

  def save
    if user.authenticate(old_password)
      user.update(password: new_password)
    end
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
def save
  user.update(email: email)
end
```

```ruby
def save
  user.update(email: email) &&
    
end
```


---

```ruby
def save
  user.email = email
  if user.valid?
    user.save!
  end
end
```

---

```ruby
def save
  user.email = email
  if user.valid?
    user.save!

  end
end
```

When I say "Predicting the Improbable", I'm not talking about anything magical.

---

???

We aren't gazing into a crystal ball and observing the future state of our bug tracker.
Instead, we can make informed predictions based on careful observation of our code.
Our goal is to reduce uncertainty about what _might_ go wrong, not say for sure what _will_ go wrong.
